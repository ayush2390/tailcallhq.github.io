- (Examples demonstrating different directive effects)

## Need of GraphQL Directives

A. Why do we need GraphQL Directives

- Limitations in query execution that directives addresses

- Benefits of integrating directives over traditional methods

B. How directives solve that problem

- (Diagram - illustration showing how directives overcomes that limitation)

## Types of Directives

A. Built-in directives

- Default directives that comes built-in GraphQL

B. Custom directives

- Customized directives to give desired results

C. Comparison between Built-in vs Custom directives

- Tabular comparison in terms of use cases, flexibility, and complexity

## Built-in Directives

A. Discussing types of built-in directives

- @skip directive
- @client directive
- @include directive

- (Explaining each directive in depth with examples)

B. Use cases for built-in directives

- Practical Scenarios where built-in directives are helpful

## Custom Directives

A. In-depth explanation of Custom directives

- Purpose of custom directives

B. How custom directives can be implemented

- Step-by-step guide on creating and integrating custom directives.

- (Diagram: a flowchart showing the whole process to implement a custom directive)

C. Use case for custom directives

## Executing GraphQL Directives in Schema and Query

A. Defining Directing in Schema
